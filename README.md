Linode, create/build/run your own online servers...for a price...

Today, 29 September 2021, I had a most truly remarkable experience; namely, I visited the 'cloud hosting' service...    
- https://www.linode.com  
...and, after reading up about the chargers for creating/building/running your own online server...;    
discovered the price is, in fact, fairly cheap; namely,...    
- £0.04p per hour  
- £30.00 monthly  
...though, one has to very carefully note...they will charge you whether the server is actually up and running/or, not...?!  

Basically, all one has to do to register with the Linode service is...give them your...    
- name    
- email  
- credit card  
...they will send you an email which you click on to confirm it's you; and, that's it you're, now, fully registered to use their services.
